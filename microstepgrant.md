### 1. What is your project? (max 100 words)
<!-- Description of your project built with Filecoin or closely related technologies (libp2p, ipfs, ipld, OrbitDB, Textile, NFT.storage, Web3.storage, Estuary, etc.) -->

<!-- Link to public Github repo -->
<!-- Link to demo or website, if applicable -->

Our project is Tokhub, aiming to be the Carta for web3.
**Tokhub's token management and distribution platform** provides the tools and insights to help you manage your token cap table, monitor your token economy and distribute your token easily.

**1.Plan your token from 0 to 1**: With the help of Tokhub, you can plan and monitor your token economic system (including token supply, token demand, token distribution and token vesting, etc).

**2.Automating your token management and distribution**: helping crypto founders and crypto investors to track and claim their token through our dashboards(ownership percentage, vesting schedule progress, etc.), and to distribute tokens automatically through our smart contracts.

**3.Employment incentive and compliance with token**: Design you employment token incentives, manage your token offer letters, legal agreements (SAFTs, token warrants, token grants) and keep compliant under regulation scrutiny.

### 2. How will IPFS, Filecoin, or related technology be used for this project? (max 100 words)

We will use IPFS nodes to store our data relating to tokens. The scope of our data for IPFS storage includes:

1) Token ownership data: the percentage ownerhships of token for key stakeholders(founders, employee, investors, community, treasury, ecosystem, etc),  with different access levels for different groups of users.
2) Token economy monitoring data: evolving and scientific metrics for token economy such as: token max supply, total circulating token, token prices, token circulating velocities, etc.
3) Token financing milestone as NFTs: key financing milestone will be minted as NFT, distributed to investors, management team and financial advisory, and stored at IPFS.
4) Token airdrop and vesting progress data: Data around token distribution, vesting, transaction and payment can also be stored at IPFS.

### 3. How will you improve your project with this grant? What steps will you take to meet this objective? (max 200 words)
<!-- Clear and concise description of the planned next step(s) or improvements for which you are seeking grant support -->
Use of grants:
1) Receiving the grant can empower us to attract better engineers to join our team, we currently need more chain developer to help us reach more public chain ecosystem: Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos, Sui, Polkadot, etc.

2) The grant can also let us allocate some resouece to marketing efforts: token design and management workshop, community building, and marketing campaign to improve our brand awareness.

Steps to meet the objectives:
1) Further develop our product and prepare for a public launch. The feature we want to incorporate into our public launch includes: 

/Token Management/

- Company information: company onboard by filling in information such as: company name, legal name, state of incorporation, address, signatories, board members, etc.
- Token ownership: track token ownership, monitor token economy and vesting progress, etc.
- Token distribution: airdrop, investor and employee, etc.(strongly related to crypto payments)
- Compliance: SAFTS, token offer letter templates, tax issues, etc.

/Token Distribution/

- Airdrop: distribute tokens to multiple wallet addresses in one click
- Investor Vesting Schedule: distribute tokens to different investors according to customized vesting schedule
- Employee Vesting Schedule: distribute tokens to employee according to customized token option agreement

2) Promiting to web3 projects across different public chains and web3 investors: crypto projects like defi/gamefi/socialfi, and crypto investors like a16z, pantera, sequoia, etc.
